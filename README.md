## About Me
My name is Kenneth Lipke, and I am currently finishing my M.Eng in ORIE with a concentration in Data Analytics. Before this, I was an undergraduate--here as well--majoring in math and economics.  

I am drawn to Bayesian statistics because I could never fully wrap my mind around the frequentist interpretation. For example, when you ask someone what they are planning on doing later, they may say there is a 50% chance they will go to the movies, and a 50% chance that they will go bowling. What does that mean? Are they telling me that if this *exact* day were repeated 10,000 times that 5,000 of them they would go to the movies, and the other 5,000 they would go bowling? No one thinks that way. It is common to hear one off events expressed in terms of probabilites, but I don't think the frequentist approach adequitely explains them. As a result, I want to learn more about the Bayesian approach, to find out if it is a more intuitive and understandable way to explain probability and statistics.

In terms of data analysis problems, I am most interested in using statistical techniques to explain rather than predict.
